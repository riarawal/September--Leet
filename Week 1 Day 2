Contains Duplicate III
Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false

Hint:
Time complexity O(n logk) - This will give an indication that sorting is involved for k elements.
   Hide Hint #2  
Use already existing state to evaluate next state - Like, a set of k sorted numbers are only needed to be tracked. When we are processing the next number in array, then we can utilize the existing sorted state and it is not necessary to sort next overlapping set of k numbers again.

        	if ( window.floor(nums[i] + t) !=null && window.floor(nums[i]+t) >= nums[i]-t ) return true; // check dup, window size <= kk right now
            window.add(new Long(nums[i]));
           
            if (i >= kk)window.remove(new Long(nums[i-kk]));//remove one, the size has to be kk on the next fresh step
