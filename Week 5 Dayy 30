First Missing Positive
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

Think about how you would solve the problem in non-constant space. Can you apply that logic to the existing space?
   Hide Hint #2  
We don't care about duplicates or non-positive integers
   Hide Hint #3  
Remember that O(2n) = O(n)
